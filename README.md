### What I do?

💖 I thrive in the dynamic field of design systems, where my expertise and passion converge. With an innate ability to understand and articulate complex design principles, I take delight in crafting elegant and scalable systems that unify the visual language of products.

As a passionate professional, my focus lies in designing robust and efficient systems that enhance overall productivity. I thoroughly enjoy creating intuitive tools that empower fellow engineers, making their tasks more streamlined and enjoyable.

Furthermore, I take pride in establishing strong frontend foundations within organizations, laying the groundwork for seamless user experiences and successful projects. With a genuine love for my work, I am dedicated to driving innovation and contributing to the growth of the teams and companies I work with.

### Story of my experience:

🕐 Started my first two years of development experience as a full-stack developer, working with PHP and Java. It was a challenging period as I had limited knowledge about various aspects of development. I had to tackle extensive and intricate relational databases built in MySQL and Oracle, along with utilizing old-school frameworks like Struts and Adobe Flex.

During this time, I primarily worked independently as a solo developer or individual contributor, dealing with challenges on my own. This provided me with invaluable opportunities to learn extensively about web development as a whole. I had the privilege of building websites from scratch using vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS, both with and without preprocessors such as Sass/Less. Some of my responsibilities during this period included:

- Translating designs, sometimes provided by the design team and other times not, into web interfaces, giving my best effort to ensure their successful implementation.
- Developing full-stack web applications using PHP/Java, along with Vanilla JS/JQuery, HTML, and CSS.
- Modifying and creating WordPress/Joomla CMS plugins and themes to align with design requirements for existing websites.

⏩ Right after my initial two years of experience, I enthusiastically transitioned into working extensively with frontend technologies and frameworks based on JavaScript. However, I did not abandon my knowledge of Vanilla JS or JQuery; rather, I continued to utilize and enhance my skills in these areas alongside exploring new technologies. This allowed me to broaden my expertise and stay adaptable to different project requirements and industry trends. By embracing the evolving landscape of JavaScript-based frontend development, I further enriched my capabilities as a well-rounded frontend developer.

🏁 One of the major highlights of my career has been the opportunity to lead and manage small frontend teams. As a team leader, I have taken on the responsibility of guiding and mentoring junior developers, helping them grow both technically and professionally. By fostering a collaborative and supportive environment, I have been able to nurture their skills and provide guidance throughout their development journey.

Additionally, I have actively contributed to frontend architecture, leveraging my expertise to design scalable and maintainable systems. By establishing best practices, coding standards, and architectural guidelines, I have helped teams streamline their development processes and deliver high-quality frontend solutions.

Through my leadership and contributions to frontend architecture, I have created a possitive impact on the success of projects and the growth of individuals within the teams I have managed. 

🗺️ Since 2018, I have been fully immersed in the remote work lifestyle, embracing the opportunity to work from anywhere.
